#+title: Haste Programming Language

Haste is a general-purpose programming language, build to match my own taste of programming. Why? because all languages sucks thats why.

#+begin_src haste
func main() {
  @println("Hello, World!"); // anything that starts with `@` is consider as macro expantion

  const mini_program = "++-++++** / * *";
  var result: fsize = 0;

  for ch in mini_program {
    match ch {
      case '+' do result += 1;
      case '-' do result -= 1;
      case '*' do result *= 2;
      case '/' do result /= 2;
      else {} // Ignore anything else
    }
  }

  @println("Result: {}", result);
}
#+end_src

* The Compiler
The compiler is nowhere is ready to use. its still under development.

* The mascot (Turbo the Turtle)
This turtle is my first ever pixel art I did, long ago in 2020. why I want it to be the mascot as my first pixel art.
